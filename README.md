# Swiggy-Like Food Delivery System

## Description
This Spring Boot application is designed to manage a food delivery system similar to Swiggy, encompassing Users, Restaurants, Customers, Orders, and Delivery Partners. The application provides a range of features, including user authentication, role-based access control, pagination, sorting, logging, and API documentation with Swagger.

## Features

### User Authentication and Authorization (this is pending)

- Secure Login: Users must authenticate as either User or Admin to access the application.

### Role-Based APIs
- User Level APIs (User Role):
  - Register User: POST /users - Register a new user.
  - User Authentication: POST /auth/login - Authenticate a user and return JWT.

  - Add Product to Order: PUT /orders/{orderId}/products - Allow a user to add a product to an order.
  - Update Order Details: PUT /orders/{orderId} - Allow a user to update order details.
  - Fetch Order History: GET /users/{userId}/orders - Fetch a user's order history.
  - Recommend Products: GET /users/{userId}/recommended-products - Recommend products to a user based on order history.

- Admin Level APIs (Admin Role):
  - Add Products: POST /products - Add new products.
  - Add Categories: POST /categories - Add new categories.
  - Add Admin User: POST /users/admin - Add new users (admin).
  - Delete Order (Admin): DELETE /orders/{orderId}/admin - Delete an order (admin).
